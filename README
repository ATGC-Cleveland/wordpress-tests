This is an alternative testing framework for WordPress. The goal is to build a framework which:

* is faster
* runs every test case in a clean WordPress install
* uses the default PHPUnit runner, instead of custom one
* doesn't encourage or support the usage of Shared/Prebuilt fixtures

It uses SQL transactions to clean up automatically after each test.

## Installation

0. Clone the project
1. Copy unittests-config-sample.php to unittests-config.php
2. Edit the config. USE A NEW DATABASE, BECAUSE ALL THE DATA INSIDE WILL BE DELETED.
3. $ phpunit all
4. $ phpunit test_test.php

The current, official test suite can be found here: http://unit-tests.trac.wordpress.org/
